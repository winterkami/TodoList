# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

This project aims to implement a simple To-Do list that allows user to add, edit, delete and mark tasks as completed. The user should also be able to set different priorities for each task, sort and filter tasks by a task property such as priority or due date. The user is able to interact with the To-Do list through a Java GUI. The motivation behind this project is to provide a simple and easy to use To-Do list that can be used by anyone. The simplicity of the project allows us to focus on the concepts and tools learned throughout the course for designing, developing, testing and deploying a software project.
